        <p>After graduating from Boston College, I joined several tech startups

          American and Hispanic markets, I recognize the unique value that Latinos offer in driving business growth,
          especially, as the US Hispanic consumer market continues to become the world's largest buying power. I know that these insights
          helped me to find jobs and advance my career, so I decided to take some time to share actionable advice for other Latinos who are starting
          out in tech.

        <p>After developing my career in Sales and Marketing, I underwent a career shift to dig deeper into my passion for tech
          and become more self-sufficient in regards to building my own business and product ideas. In 2017, I took a leap from sales to software engineering
          and haven't looked back since. My transition was immediately life-changing and more than I had hoped for. Each day, I thank God for
          enabling me to fuel my relentless pursuit of creativity and innovation through engineering. I am inspired to give back, by planting seed that will grow into fruit, that
          will be shared with the same world that continues to inspire me. In this post, I share insights to a newfound world of possibilities that will be revealed to you, with your newfound skills.

        without a server-side, so that the app doesn't reset each time it is opened, or the browser gets refreshed.
        Although there are a few ways to do this, for example using cookies, I leveraged local storage.</p>
